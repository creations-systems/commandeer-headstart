## Installation

We make use of the Linux Ubuntu machine in ["paperspace"](https://paperspace.com) called "Infrastructure".

### Install Application from Ubuntu Software directly

From the Ubuntu Software on the machine, search for "Commandeer" and download and install it directly from there.

### Install Application in Ubuntu Using AppImage

Deb package, and RPM file formats are used for installing software on Debian or Ubuntu, and Fedora/SUSE based Linux distro respectively. There is a problem for the app developer that they have to maintain multiple packages for various Linux distributions. To overcome this problem, AppImage comes into the picture for offering a universal package management system for all the Linux distros.

An AppImage file format is similar to the .exe file used in Windows system. But with the. AppImage format, there is no extraction or installation, you delete AppImage, the software will be removed from Ubuntu, and double click on AppImage will run the application.

- Download .appimage package.

- Make it executable by following Right Click on software >> Properties >> Permission Tab >> Check â€œAllow executing the file as program.

- Now run the program.
